# Browser-catüéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: dotfile


### Team Members
- Team Lead:Dijith Dinesh - Model Engineering College
### Project Description
Its a browser extension that adds  some pets(cats) to yor  browser they will run, walk and play in websites you visit, you can feed them with the  text from the page itself  or pet it by dragging the pet. don't let them starve. they deserves üéî

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People love pets even if they are useless,like cats. with the internet and rise of AI(Hell yeah more views for this page now) we don't have enough time to spent with pets(dumb thing anyway) ,atleast in our direct reach of eye.
- felt alone while browsing web?
- ever felt you want to eat the delicious animals(ascii) on the screen?
- ever felt like you need a pet that never poop.
- ever felt like you need someone to spent time with(like the girl-friend you never had).

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
introducing to you the browser-cat
- cats that you love to spent time with.
- they live along with you, inside screen,wherever you visit, to keep you company
- cats that play  backflip run walk all over your screen.
well even though they don't have any emotions(like your actual cat). you can pet them and give food if you wish.
- it keeps you company,when writing stupid readme like this in the last moment,
- it never gonna delete your entire readme  becuase you didn't feed it.(why is my words in readme fallling apart)
- the more tabs you open you gets more pets(yeah that's a feature)
## features(yeah)
- number of pets equal to no of open tabs.
- playful cute cats using sprites.
- feed cats to keep browsing.
- or your website  breaks down.
- keep the pets healthy.
- really useful when working with llm's  you can feed *you are absolutely right* to your pets
